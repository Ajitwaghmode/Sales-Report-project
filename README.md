Check out my new Power BI dashboard ðŸ“Š I created this dashboard by importing and cleaning data,
using Power Query Editor for transformations, and leveraging DAX for calculations.
The dashboard includes advanced charts, filters, and slicers for interactive exploration. 
With forecasting capabilities, it provides valuable insights on sales trends and performance.
The design is user-friendly, and the dashboard offers insightful information for decision-making.
Feel free to reach out to me for further exploration of the data.
